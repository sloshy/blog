title: TinyDB September 2023 Update
---
As we are nearing the end of Summer 2023, some of you might have been hoping for [some news about TinyDB](/2023/06/20/intro-tinydb/), a ScalaJS-based relational database in your web browser with spreadsheet-like usability.
There is not too much to talk about today, but to give you an idea of what to expect I am hoping to clarify some scheduling updates as time has marched on.

## Where is TinyDB?
Worry not; TinyDB is still coming, and you will all be able to use it later this year.
Originally I had expected TinyDB to be available in a limited beta format by this time, but there have been some delays due to various factors.
Nothing complicated with the code, actually, but it would be more accurate to say that I simply have not had the time to work on the project as much as I would like.
The past several months at my day job have been quite hectic and things show little sign of slowing down, so at the end of each work day doing even more coding staring at my computer screen is often the last thing I want to do.
So for most of the past few months I have been taking some mental health time, spending some quality time with my four beautiful pets (two of which are Australian Shepherd dogs, known for their impossibly high energy levels and demanding personalities).
Besides this, I'm sure you can sympathize with how the latest and greatest video games have been coming out on a near weekly basis this summer and also eating up what little free time I have on the weekends as well.
Baldur's Gate 3 and Starfield will eventually come for us all.

So, recognizing this, I am going to start ensuring that I at least have something to show for the project moving forward up to twice a month.
Starting in October you will see an update on everything I have been able to accomplish during the month of September, and there might be a second update as well later in the month as more developments and plans are made.

## TinyDB Roadmap
So you might be wondering, what should you expect from these updates?
What features have yet to be developed, and what milestones are there right now?
I have put together this loose outline of the features I will be working on, and approximate levels of priority for when I hope to get done with them.

* File Format Specification - September 2023
* Early Mobile UI Support - September/October 2023
* Early Beta Access - October 2023
* Additional chart types - 2023
* Grid Layout Mode - 2023
* Cloud Storage Support - Late 2023 / Early 2024
* Public Beta Access - Early / Mid 2024
* Triggers - 2024
* More Functions & Custom Hooks - 2024
* Funding & Sustainability Plans - 2024?

As you can see, most of these features I'll try to implement some time this year, and the early Beta access will actually start before almost all of these features and more will be implemented.
This early version will be mostly equivalent to the version developed for ScalaDays Seattle 2023, to start, with some minor enhancements to make sure it works at a basic, feature-complete level for normal database tasks.
You will have tables, some basic functions and queries, JOINs, very basic chart support, basic mobile UI, and the ability to save your database to a standard file format.
In fact, the file format right now is basically a dump of the memory contents, which is not optimal for file size or future feature support.
Getting that file format standardized is currently my highest priority and the main blocker for getting a version of this app available for people to use.

## What about that donation?
Oh, yes, of course.
I have not forgotten about my pledge to donate on behalf of any and all early supporters who have subscribed to the TinyDB email list with a special secret code.
A few of you were a little colorful with your choice of code and not everyone inputted the code exactly the same, but rounding out the list and fudging the numbers a bit to account for those inexact codes, it looks like we have a total of __fifteen pledges__, meaning I have donated $150 to The Trevor Project.

Thanks to your interest in my project this money can go towards helping prevent LGBT+ suicide, in a time when so much uncertainty, bigotry and hatred out there for people who want to peacefully be themselves.
I and the TinyDB project are happy to put our money where our mouth is and be a proud supporter of LGBT+ lives whenever possible.

## How can I hear more?
Go to [TinyDB.app](https://tinydb.app/) today and enter your email address into the form to get early beta access within the next month (or two, if there's another delay).
You will also get email notifications every time there is a feature or development update.
You are free to unsubscribe at any time.

Thank you everyone for your understanding and support.
I look forward to getting TinyDB into your hands very soon!
